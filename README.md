<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is created for the Java FSD Full Stack, phase 2, a course thaug by the academy [simplilearn.com](https://www.simplilearn.com/). In this phase we cover a overview of Java EE, how we can create dinamyc webpage with Java, and also using tools like the framework Hibernate for the ORM, using Servlets and also the fundamentals of the MVC model. The requisites of the webpage are the following:

1. A search form in the homepage to allow entry of travel details, like the date of travel, source, destination, and the number of persons.
2. Based on the travel details entered, it will show the available flights with their ticket prices.
3. Once a person selects a flight to book, they will be taken to a register page where they must fill in their personal details. In the next page, they are shown the flight details of the flight that they are booking, and the payment is done via a dummy payment gateway. On completion of the payment, they are shown a confirmation page with the details of the booking.   
 
Also, we need an admin webpage with the following features:
1. An admin login page where the admin can change the password after login, if he wishes
2. A master list of places for source and destination
3. A master list of airlines
4. A list of flights where each flight has a source, destination, airline, and ticket price


<!-- ADVICE -->
## Advice

As this project have only a educational prupouse, is not recomendend to install and configure it. Some points are insecure, for example, we are storing the admin passwords in plain text
